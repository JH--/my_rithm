Flask Templating
Create a new Flask application with the following:

Part 1
A base.html template for others to inherit from
A route for /person/<name>/<age> which renders a 
template that displays the name and age entered 
for the URL. That template should inherit from 
base.html


Part 2
Refactor your calculator application from before!

have a route for /calculate which renders a 
template called calc.html
in calc.html, build a form which has two inputs 
(one with a name of num1 and another with the name 
of num2for numbers and a select field with the name 
of calculation with options for "add", "subract", 
"multiply" and "divide".
When the form is submitted it should make a request 
to a route called /math
In your python file, accept the values from the form
and depending on what the request contains, respond
with the sum, difference, product or quotient.



Part 3
Create a small application which grabs headlines 
from Google News by keyword. (This application is 
based on the Google News web scraper from the web 
scraping exercises.)

This application should consist of two routes, 
/ and /results
When the server receives a request to /, it should 
render an HTML page with a form prompting the user 
for a keyword (e.g. "California"). Submitting the 
form should result in a request to /results, with 
the form input passed in the query string.
When the server receives a request to /results, it 
should do the following:
Grab the keyword from the query string;
Make a request to https://news.google.com, and scrape
 the respose HTML for all news articles (links and 
 headlines);
Filter out articles whose headlines do not match the 
keyword passed in from the query string;
Render an HTML page with matching articles (links and 
headlines) in a list.
